"""Phase detection + narration (§5, and the SCREEN 3 text from §4).

Given a generated timeline, detect the four phases and return narration strings.
Tone follows §6 strictly: mechanism language, second-person descriptive, no
shame, no prescription, no success/failure framing. The narration's whole job is
the §4 insight — that the crash below baseline is the mechanism, it is
predictable, and it is not a moral failure.

Phase-narration templates live here (not copy.py) because they are filled by the
detection logic below — see DECISIONS.md D4. copy.py holds the static chrome.
