"""Every static user-facing string, in one place (§5 layout, §6 tone).

Tone rules (§6), enforced by tests/test_copy_tone.py:
  Never: addiction/addict, clean, sober, relapse, failure, quit; "you should",
         "you need to", "try to"; success/failure framing; streaks/badges/scores.
  Always: loop / pattern / cycle / episode; mechanism language; second-person
          descriptive not prescriptive; agency-restoring ("this is predictable").

Generated phase narration lives in narrate.py (coupled to detection logic — see
DECISIONS.md D4). Everything else — chrome, questions, disclaimer, resources,
about — is here. The structure is i18n-ready: strings hang off the COPY dict
under a language key; swap "en" for another locale without touching app.py.

Branding: APP_NAME is the single source of the product name (§2). Changing the
name is a one-line edit here.
